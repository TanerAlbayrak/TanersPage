																            <div><b>Welcome to Taner's web page. This is an introduction page for 91.461.  I am a computer science student in my fourth year and hope to design
																	                        wonderful web pages in the near future.  For now, it is lacking style but soon enough it
																				                    will have plenty of style and design.  Links will be added to the menu as well.</b></div>
